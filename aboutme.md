title: About me
---

I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida, where I gained an appreciation for naturalism and the world's oceans; I followed this passion to Boston University where I studied Marine Science and Biology and honed my skills as an ecologist and field biologist. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I recognized the need for new methods that allow researchers to use their data sets to their full potential.  This inspired me to pursue a path that allowed me to incorporate fieldwork and develop new tools using machine learning methods for biological datasets. I work as a PhD student at Cornell University with Dr. Andrew Hein in the computational biology department.  I am passionate about both creating data, through fieldwork, and building tools that allow ecologists to best utilize existing and underutilized data sets to push the field forward. Currently, I am working to build computer vision models that can detect and classify behaviors of organisms observed in the field.
